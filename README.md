# Warbler

A Twitter clone with a Rithm spin - Rails edition!

### Installation

Clone the repo and `cd` into it. From the root of the project:

```sh
# install all dependencies
bundle install

# create database
rake db:create

# migrate database to latest version
rake db:migrate

# seed database with dummy data
# (this will take a while)
rake db:seed

# start rails server!
rails s
```

You may wish to compare the code here with the [Python version.](https://github.com/rithmschool/warbler)
